shlib - shell functions in bash or zsh

This directory comprises my shell function library.  The functions here
can be run as commands in a bourne compatible shell.   Some functions
that are zsh specific are kept separately.

all     - this is a driver for sourcing all the rest of the files, if you
          don't want all the functions, rename with a leading . or remove
          them.  There is also an exception list in this file so that it 
          doesn't call itself recursively (so don't rename it either), and 
          so that it skips i.e. this file (NOTES -- don't rename).
